## Write-up: üìù<br>
In this chall, we need to read a filename contain "space". Normally, when we use command (for example: cat) with " " in file name, they will split into 2 file , seperated by that space. So in this case, we have a special syntax to tell that this is one file with spaces contained<br>
Syntax: `cat '{file name with space}' `<br>
Alternative:<br>
`cat "{file name with space}" `<br>
`cat {file\ name\ with\ space} `<br>
### Solution:<br>
Command: `cat "spaces in this filename"`<br>
