**NOTE:** if you have solved this level and see ‚ÄòByebye!‚Äô when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19<br>
- **Commands you may need to solve this level:**<br>

## Write-up: üìù<br>
In this chall, we are kicked out when we login by "ssh". We can solve this chall by force another type of terminal to be allocated<br>
Use `man ssh` for more details
### Solution:<br>
- We **ssh** and use special flag "-t" to **force the pseudo-terminal allocation(PTY)**: `ssh -t bandit.labs.overthewire.org -l bandit18 -p 2220 /bin/sh`<br>
Here, i use the "TTY" terminal, its path is **/bin/sh**<br>
- Then `cat` **readme** file
### Other solution:<br>
We can use "-T" flag to disable the PTY allocation and communicate with shell, then the rest is similar.
