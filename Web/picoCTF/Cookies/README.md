The website allow to search cookie with the name
Inspect the cookie with **Developer Tools**, we notice that there is a key `name` that store the id of the cookie, so we just bruteforce with this index, no need to brute force the name of the cookie

My [Python script](/Web/picoCTF/Cookies/solve.py) loop through increasing index (1000 loop times should be good enough), then check if the flag is returned
