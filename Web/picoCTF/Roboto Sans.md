### Solution: üíØ

We have a website with nothing really special.

The title of the challenge is **Roboto Sans**, this hinted to us that we'll need to inspect `robots.txt` file. [Find more information here!](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro#:~:text=txt-,A%20robots.,or%20password%2Dprotect%20the%20page.). Move to that **file path**.

There's another hint telling us that we are near to the flag - "Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.". We notice that there's a base64-encoded string `anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==`. We use [this tools](https://www.base64decode.org/) to decode. We get decoded string: `js/myfile.txt`. 

Move to that file path `http://saturn.picoctf.net:65442/js/myfile.txt`. Hurray ! We got the flag.
